# ZKLR: Zero-Knowledge Liquidity and Rewards Protocol

ZKLR is a Solana-based decentralized protocol that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and confidential transactions to enable secure staking, liquidity provision, and bandwidth allocation. The protocol ensures privacy and fairness while incentivizing participants through adaptive rewards and penalties. It is designed for high-frequency traders (HFTs), institutional market makers, and liquidity providers who demand confidentiality and low latency in trade execution.
